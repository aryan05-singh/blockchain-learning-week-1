 A blockchain is a decentralized,it is very important for us and it is distributed ledger technology that records a chain of transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and these blocks are linked together.cryptocurrencies is a part  of blockchain.It is makes decentralized app.that techonology not save our data.

 # Types of blockchain
 ## Three types of blockchain
 1.public Blockchain

 2.private Blockchain

 3.Hybrid Blockchain

# Key of blockchain
1.**Block** = It is give information when any transtions is done a block is created. It is create unique hash for every block

2.**Node** = It is perform different operation. It is two tpye node makes new blocks.It is consumed very high storage.

3.**Ledger** = A ledger is a kind of database. When transactions are confirmed  a ledger is created.

4.**Wallet** = *Very high sequrity.No intermediate party involve and transactions charges very low or little.Key is very important in wallet private key do not share any body*.



# Summarize the articles in your own words.

# Satoshi Nakamoto  who invented and implemented the first blockchain network he is developed first digital currency bitcoin.blockchain is a techonology work upon peer to peer network and also it is did work in decentralized network it means there has no central point it is totally independent and you control your bank account and you send money any person without any bank. this is is faster than other bank account and also this is sequre it is like internet . no one can hacked this techonology. we create ledgers to store information. And you also says it is future of world and blockchain techonology makes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and most famous blockchain currency is ethereum . its data never loose and put digital record of transactions and data places multiple places in computer. and this is not control by any one people.Ethereum was developed by Vitlaik Buterin.Ethereum network is a decentralized or peer-to-peer network like bitcoin there are four types of blockchain public blockchain,private blockchain,hybrid blockchain ,side chains public blockchain used by any person it is decentralized  and biggest example of public blockchain is ethereum and bitcoin.private blockchain is not used by any person you want to permission used bfore  it it is decentralized example of private blockchain is hyperledger. it is combination of public and private blockchains and also contain centralized and decentralized features example of hybrid blockchain is R3.cryptocurrencies is a digital currency it is not form of coins. cryptocurrencies are decentralized and it is operated by blockchain techonology Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any central authority cryptocurrencies transactions are recorded on a public blockchain anyone view history any time. Bitcoin and Etherum are the two biggest example of  cryptocurrencies.
